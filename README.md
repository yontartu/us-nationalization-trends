# Plotting Trends in the Nationalization of US Politics

Using data collected by [Amlani and Algara (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379421001050?dgcid=author#b5), I wanted to explore how US politics have become increasingly nationalized. One way to see this is looking at county-level correlations in vote choice: in recent years, the correlation between counties' Democratic voteshare for president and their Democratic voteshare for senate has grown increasingly strong, and is now (as of 2020) nearly 1.
